==> container class
-------------------
--> .container class provide a responsive fixed width container.
    -> .container class provide a default margin form left and right side of the page by default.

--> .container-fluid class provide a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.
    -> .container class doesn't provide a default margin form left and right side of the page by default. It consider full width of the page.

==> Bootstrap typography(typography is a appearance and a way of representation of text, and how we can change that)
------------------------
--> Bootstrap uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5

--> Default font-family is "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, Arial, sans-serif.

--> All <p> tags elements have margin-top:0 and margin-bottom: 1rem(1 rem = 16 pixel)

--> display class
    -> display class is a typography in which we are increasing the size of the content but not in bold style.
    -> There ara four types of display > display-1, display-2, display-3, display-4

--> font weights and style
    -> class 'font-weight-bold' is used for the make the content bold.
    -> class 'font-weight-bolder' is used for the make the content more bolder.
    -> class 'font-weight-normal' is used to make the content normal. It removes all the weights like italic, bold etc.
    -> class 'font-weight-light' is going to make the content light
    -> class 'font-weight-lighter' is going to make the content more lighter
    -> class 'font-italic' is used to make the content in italic style.
    -> class 'small' is used to make the content small just like <small> tag

--> text- classes
    -> 'text-center' is used to make the content appeared in the center position.
    -> 'text-uppercase' is used to convert all the content in the upper case.

--> text colors
    -> 'text-muted' means dark silver
    -> 'text-primary' means light blue
    -> 'text-success' means green
    -> 'text-info' means ocean
    -> 'text-warning' means yellow
    -> 'text-danger' means red
    -> 'text-secondary' means dark silver
    -> 'text-white' means white color
    -> 'text-white-50 ' means white color
    -> 'text-dark' means 80% black      generally used in nav bar
    -> 'text-light' means white color   generally used in nav bar

    -> if we want to provide the custom color then we have specify in the style tag in 'color' attribute like 'color:green;'
        because bootstrap provide only 10 pre-defined color. Those color are defined above.
    -> Simply overriding the value of color doesn't change of the content, because bootstrap forces the browser to use the classes defined by the bootstrap.
        so if we want to provide our own properties then we should use "!important;" after each value that we want to override.

--> background colors
    -> 'bg-primary' means blue
    -> 'bg-success' means green
    -> 'bg-info' means ocean
    -> 'bg-warning' means yellow
    -> 'bg-danger' means  red
    -> 'bg-secondary' means dark silver
    -> 'bg-dark' means 80* black
    -> 'bg-light' means very light color (like 2% black and 98% white)
    -> 'bg-transparent' means transparent background

    -> if we want to provide the custom background-color then we have specify in the style tag in 'background-color' attribute like 'background-color:green;'
        because bootstrap provide only 8 pre-defined color. Those color are defined above.

    -> Simply overriding the value of color doesn't change of the content, because bootstrap forces the browser to use the classes defined by the bootstrap.
        so if we want to provide our own properties then we should use "!important;" after each value that we want to override.
    -> If we have applied any class which doesn't exist then at the time of overriding !important; is not required.
        Ex: bg-muted is not a class in bootstrap so in this case if we override the value for the background color then background will reflect
        but in any pre-defined 'bg-' class if we are trying to override the background color then "!important;" is required.
Some HTML tags
--------------
--> <small></small> tag is used to display something in very small font-size

--> <mark></mark> tag is used to highlight the content.

--> <abbr title="Full Form"> Short Name<abbr> is used to represents the abbrevation

--> <blockquote class="blockquote">
        Some definition
        <p class="blockquote-footer">Who gave the definition</p>
    </blockquote>
    this is used to represents the test like we saw in the books 'After the definition writer name is shown with the dash after the definition'

--> <code></code>, it changes the color of the content like we see in the content code is written in the different color.

--> <kbd></kdb> this tag name is "keyboard", it highlight the content.

--> <pre> tag doesn't change the content structure. It displays the content as defined in the tag itself. It doesn't manege the spaces.
