--> All <p> tags elements have margin-top:0 and margin-bottom: 1rem(1 rem = 16 pixel)

    -> display class is a typography in which we are increasing the size of the content but not in bold style.
    -> There ara four types of display > display-1, display-2, display-3, display-4

--> font weights and style
    -> class 'font-weight-bold' is used for the make the content bold.
    -> class 'font-weight-bolder' is used for the make the content more bolder.
    -> class 'font-weight-normal' is used to make the content normal. It removes all the weights like italic, bold etc.
    -> class 'font-weight-light' is going to make the content light
    -> class 'font-weight-lighter' is going to make the content more lighter
    -> class 'font-italic' is used to make the content in italic style.

Some HTML tags
--------------
--> <small></small> tag is used to display something in very small font-size

--> <mark></mark> tag is used to highlight the content.

--> <abbr title="Full Form"> Short Name<abbr> is used to represents the abbrevation

--> <blockquote class="blockquote">
        Some definition
        <p class="blockquote-footer">Who gave the definition</p>
    </blockquote>
    this is used to represents the test like we saw in the books 'After the definition writer name is shown with the dash after the definition'

--> <code></code>, it changes the color of the content like we see in the content code is written in the different color.

--> <kbd></kdb> this tag name is "keyboard", it highlight the content.
